### Key Findings

- **Bubble** scores highest overall, excelling in flexibility, value, and community strength. It is the most versatile no-code platform for web applications, with a thriving ecosystem and extensive support resources.
- **OutSystems** is the enterprise leader, with unmatched security, governance, and scalability. However, its high cost and complexity restrict its appeal to large organizations or regulated industries.
- **Webflow** stands out for designer-oriented web app and site creation, offering stunning visual control and a robust CMS, although it is less suited to highly interactive or logic-driven applications.

Other platforms like Mendix and Adalo are strong contenders for specific segments—Mendix in enterprise and Adalo for simple mobile/web apps—but do not match the all-around value of the top three.
